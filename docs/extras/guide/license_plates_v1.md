title: EU License Plate OCR PHP
---
The PHP OCR SDK supports the [License Plate API](https://platform.mindee.com/mindee/license_plates).

Using the [sample below](https://github.com/mindee/client-lib-test-data/blob/main/products/license_plates/default_sample.jpg), we are going to illustrate how to extract the data that we want using the OCR SDK.
![License Plate sample](https://github.com/mindee/client-lib-test-data/blob/main/products/license_plates/default_sample.jpg?raw=true)

# Quick-Start
```php
<?php

use Mindee\Client;
use Mindee\Product\Eu\LicensePlate\LicensePlateV1;

// Init a new client
$mindeeClient = new Client("my-api-key");

// Load a file from disk
$inputSource = $mindeeClient->sourceFromPath("/path/to/the/file.ext");

// Parse the file
$apiResponse = $mindeeClient->parse(LicensePlateV1::class, $inputSource);

echo $apiResponse->document;
```

**Output (RST):**
```rst
########
Document
########
:Mindee ID: f0f48232-2c80-4473-9c6f-88a09111b84d
:Filename: default_sample.jpg

# Field Types
## Standard Fields
These fields are generic and used in several products.

### BasicField
Each prediction object contains a set of fields that inherit from the generic `BaseField` class.
A typical `BaseField` object will have the following attributes:

* **value** (`float|string`): corresponds to the field value. Can be `null` if no value was extracted.
* **confidence** (`float`): the confidence score of the field prediction.
* **boundingBox** (`[Point, Point, Point, Point]`): contains exactly 4 relative vertices (points) coordinates of a right rectangle containing the field in the document.
* **polygon** (`Point[]`): contains the relative vertices coordinates (`Point`) of a polygon containing the field in the image.
* **pageId** (`integer`): the ID of the page, is `null` when at document-level.
* **reconstructed** (`bool`): indicates whether an object was reconstructed (not extracted as the API gave it).

> **Note:** A `Point` simply refers to a List of two numbers (`[float, float]`).


Aside from the previous attributes, all basic fields have access to a custom `__toString` method that can be used to print their value as a string.

### StringField
The text field `StringField` only has one constraint: its **value** is an optional `?string`.

# Attributes
The following fields are extracted for License Plate V1:

## License Plates
**licensePlates** : List of all license plates found in the image.

```php
foreach ($result->document->inference->prediction->licensePlates as $licensePlatesElem)
{
    echo $licensePlatesElem->value;
}
```
