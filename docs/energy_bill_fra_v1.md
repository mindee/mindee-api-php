The PHP OCR SDK supports the [Energy Bill API](https://platform.mindee.com/mindee/energy_bill_fra).

The [sample below](https://github.com/mindee/client-lib-test-data/blob/main/products/energy_bill_fra/default_sample.jpg) can be used for testing purposes.
![Energy Bill sample](https://github.com/mindee/client-lib-test-data/blob/main/products/energy_bill_fra/default_sample.jpg?raw=true)

# Quick-Start
```php
<?php

use Mindee\Client;
use Mindee\Product\Fr\EnergyBill\EnergyBillV1;

// Init a new client
$mindeeClient = new Client("my-api-key");

// Load a file from disk
$inputSource = $mindeeClient->sourceFromPath("/path/to/the/file.ext");

// Parse the file asynchronously
$apiResponse = $mindeeClient->enqueueAndParse(EnergyBillV1::class, $inputSource);

echo $apiResponse->document;
```
# Field Types
## Standard Fields
These fields are generic and used in several products.

### BaseField
Each prediction object contains a set of fields that inherit from the generic `BaseField` class.
A typical `BaseField` object will have the following attributes:

* **value** (`float|string`): corresponds to the field value. Can be `null` if no value was extracted.
* **confidence** (`float`): the confidence score of the field prediction.
* **boundingBox** (`[Point, Point, Point, Point]`): contains exactly 4 relative vertices (points) coordinates of a right rectangle containing the field in the document.
* **polygon** (`Point[]`): contains the relative vertices coordinates (`Point`) of a polygon containing the field in the image.
* **pageId** (`integer`): the ID of the page, always `null` when at document-level.
* **reconstructed** (`bool`): indicates whether an object was reconstructed (not extracted as the API gave it).

> **Note:** A `Point` simply refers to a list of two numbers (`[float, float]`).


Aside from the previous attributes, all basic fields have access to a custom `__toString` method that can be used to print their value as a string.


### AmountField
The amount field `AmountField` only has one constraint: its **value** is an optional `?float`.

### DateField
Aside from the basic `BaseField` attributes, the date field `DateField` also implements the following: 

* **dateObject** (`date`): an accessible representation of the value as a php object. Can be `null`.

### StringField
The text field `StringField` implements the following:
* **value** (`string`): represents the value of the field as a string.
* **rawValue** (`string`): the value of the string as it appears on the document.
